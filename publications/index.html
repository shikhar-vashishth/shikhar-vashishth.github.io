    <p>Word embeddings have been widely adopted across several NLP applications. Most existing word embedding methods utilize sequential context of a word to learn its embedding. While there have been some attempts at utilizing syntactic context of a word, such methods result in an explosion of the vocabulary size. In this paper, we overcome this problem by proposing SynGCN, a flexible Graph Convolution based method for learning word embeddings. SynGCN utilizes the dependency context of a word without increasing the vocabulary size. Word embeddings learned by SynGCN outperform existing methods on various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks and provide an advantage when used with ELMo. We also propose SemGCN, an effective framework for incorporating diverse semantic knowledge for further enhancing learned word representations. We make the source code of both models available to encourage reproducible research.</p>

    <p>Predicting properties of nodes in a graph is an important problem with applications in a variety of domains. Graph-based Semi Supervised Learning (SSL) methods aim to address this problem by labeling a small subset of the nodes as seeds, and then utilizing the graph structure to predict label scores for the rest of the nodes in the graph. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive performance on the graph-based SSL task. In addition to label scores, it is also desirable to have confidence scores associated with them. Unfortunately, confidence estimation in the context of GCN has not been previously explored. We fill this important gap in this paper and propose ConfGCN, which estimates labels scores along with their confidences jointly in GCN-based setting. ConfGCN uses these estimated confidences to determine the influence of one node on another during neighborhood aggregation, thereby acquiring anisotropic1 capabilities. Through extensive analysis and experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that ConfGCN is able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines. We have made ConfGCN’s source code available to encourage reproducible research.</p>

    <p>Semi-supervised learning on graph structured data has received significant attention with the recent introduction of Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). While traditional methods have focused on optimizing a loss augmented with Laplacian regularization framework, GCNs perform an implicit Laplacian type regularization to capture local graph structure. In this work, we propose Lovasz Convolutional Network (LCNs) which are capable of incorporating global graph properties. LCNs achieve this by utilizing Lovasz’s orthonormal embeddings of the nodes. We analyse local and global properties of graphs and demonstrate settings where LCNs tend to work better than GCNs. We validate the proposed method on standard random graph models such as stochastic block models (SBM) and certain community structure based graphs where LCNs outperform GCNs and learn more intuitive embeddings. We also perform extensive binary and multi-class classification experiments on real world datasets to demonstrate LCN’s effectiveness. In addition to simple graphs, we also demonstrate the use of LCNs on hyper-graphs by identifying settings where they are expected to work better than GCNs.</p>

    <p>Distantly-supervised Relation Extraction (RE) methods train an extractor by automatically aligning relation instances in a Knowledge Base (KB) with unstructured text. In addition to relation instances, KBs often contain other relevant side information, such as aliases of relations (e.g., founded and co-founded are aliases for the relation founderOfCompany). RE models usually ignore such readily available side information. In this paper, we propose RESIDE, a distantly-supervised neural relation extraction method which utilizes additional side information from KBs for improved relation extraction. It uses entity type and relation alias information for imposing soft constraints while predicting relations. RESIDE employs Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to encode syntactic information from text and improves performance even when limited side information is available. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate RESIDE’s effectiveness. We have made RESIDE’s source code available to encourage reproducible research.</p>

    <p>Document date is essential for many important tasks, such as document retrieval, summarization, event detection, etc. While existing approaches for these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted features while ignoring such documentinternal structures. In this paper, we propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based document dating approach which jointly exploits syntactic and temporal graph structures of document in a principled way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning for the problem of document dating. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we find that NeuralDater significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute (45% relative) accuracy points</p>

    <p>Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) methods extract (noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase) triples from text, resulting in the construction of large Open Knowledge Bases (Open KBs). The noun phrases (NPs) and relation phrases in such Open KBs are not canonicalized, leading to the storage of redundant and ambiguous facts. Recent research has posed canonicalization of Open KBs as clustering over manually-defined feature spaces. Manual feature engineering is expensive and often sub-optimal. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose Canonicalization using Embeddings and Side Information (CESI) – a novel approach which performs canonicalization over learned embeddings of Open KBs. CESI extends recent advances in KB embedding by incorporating relevant NP and relation phrase side information in a principled manner. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate CESI’s effectiveness.</p>

    <p>In SDN based networks, for network management such as monitoring, performance tuning, enforcing security, configurations, calculating QoS metrics etc. a certain fraction of traffic is responsible. It consists of packets for many network protocols such as DHCP, MLD, MDNS, NDP etc. Most of the time these packets are created and absorbed at midway switches. We refer to these as raw packets. Cumulative statistics of sent and received traffic is sent to the controller by OpenFlow compliant switches that includes these raw packets. Although, not part of the data traffic these packets get counted and leads to noise in the measured statistics and thus, hamper the accuracy of methods that depend on these statistics such as calculation of QoS metrics.</p>

    <p>In order to meet QoS demands from customers, currently, ISPs over-provision capacity. Networks need to continuously monitor performance metrics, such as bandwidth, packet loss etc., in order to quickly adapt forwarding rules in response to changes in the workload. The packet loss metric is also required by network administrators and ISPs to identify clusters in network that are vulnerable to congestion. However, the existing solutions either require special instrumentation of the network or impose significant measurement overhead.</p>

    <p>Most of the content sharing applications use the client/server model in which all of group managements are done by the server and this sometimes becomes a communication bottleneck. Installing specialized software for different purposes such as file sharing, video conferencing etc., becomes a barrier for the user. Recent technologies like NodeJs and Socket.io have fostered new ideas the ways web browsers can be used. Moreover, the emerging standards of WebRTC open up new paradigm of direct communication channel between web browsers without relaying the data through a web server. But there are certain issues such as lack of full-fledged threading/concurrency support in the JavaScript language, reliance on synchronous loading etc. that restricts modern day browsers to take full advantage of current multiprocessing capabilities. Although, on one hand there are advantages of using web browsers, such as no requirement of specialized software, benefits of emerging technologies etc., the aforementioned issues pose challenges in implementation in certain areas. In this paper, we have tried to couple the benefits of peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture (elimination of centralized dependency, better scalability, shareability etc.) along with the advantages of recent web technologies (NodeJs, WebRTC etc.) by designing and implementing a browser based P2P content sharing framework. We have addressed the aforementioned challenges of a browser based P2P architecture by providing a mechanism to exchange messages asynchronously and facilitating new peer joins via existing peers in the network, thus reducing the dependency on bootstrap server. Our prototypical implementation demonstrates the feasibility, efficiency and scalability of this lightweight framework, on the top of which a variety of applications can be added as a layer of functionality.</p>

    <p>The utilization of the networks in education system has become increasingly widespread in recent years. WebRTC has been one of the hottest topics recently when it comes to Web technologies for distributed systems as it enables peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity between machines with higher reliability and better scalability without the overhead of resource management. In this paper, we propose a browser based, asynchronous framework of a P2P network using distributed, lookup protocol (Chord), NodeJS and RTCDataChannel; which is scalable and lightweight. The design combines the advantages of P2P networks for better and sophisticated education delivery. The framework will facilitate students to share course content and discuss with fellow students without requiring any centralized infrastructure support.</p>
